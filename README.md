===========

Ever wondered why fresh water is so nutritious?

or why ground nutmeg is THIS

Well this mod fixes that by changing the food values of all harvest craft 2 foods to be more in line with the 1.12.2 version of harvest craft. Along with a few tag fixes to fix things like bananas and avocados being considered eggs.

If requested i may add a few config options to just nerf game breaking foods like the fresh water. But for now it will revert all food values to 1.12.2 values.

### Building the mod
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a command line and execute ```gradlew build```

Pull requests are very welcome, and i suspect most changes will be tag related as i havent entirely gone over that.


You are free to use this in any modpack, credit is nice though :3
