===========

Ever wondered why fresh water is so nutritious?

or why ground nutmeg is THIS

Well this mod fixes that by providing options to change the food values of all harvest craft 2 foods to be more in line with the 1.12.2 version of harvest craft. Along with a few tag fixes to fix things like bananas and avocados being considered eggs.

### Features
- Changes the food values of all harvest craft 2 foods to be in line with the 1.12.2 version of harvest craft.
- Fixes game breaking foods like fresh water, oil, etc.
- Can also nerf default minecraft foods as 1.12.2 does
- Above features are configurable
- Fixes some tags so they make sense in recipes


### Building the mod
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a command line and execute ```gradlew build```

Pull requests are very welcome, and i suspect most changes will be tag related as i havent entirely gone over that.


You are free to use this in any modpack, credit is nice though :3
